    "# Final Project Poster and Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this semester, you have been digging deep into the literature on a topic that you find important, relevant, and exciting in the field of robotics. Now, it's time to put the proposal you submitted into practice, and perform an experiment or two to answer your research question. This research question is **not** the same as the one you posed in your literature review. This time, the question is about whether something is possible. Your final project should answer that question!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your chance to show the utility of what you've learned this semester in lieu of a final exam. In addition to your paper, you will also have the opportunity to (and are required to) present your work to your peers at the ME497 joint poster session **from 8-11AM on Tuesday, December 17 in Rockwell Integrated Sciences Center (RISC) 3rd floor.**"

    "## Final Paper: Due Friday, December 13, 2024. *No Extensions!*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write and format your paper as if you're submitting it to the [IEEE Transactions on Robotics](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ro/information-for-authors) journal as a \"regular paper.\" The journal allows submissions up to 20 pages long, but charges extra for papers longer than 12 pages in IEEE two-column format, so use 12 as a soft upper limit inclusive of tables, equations, figures, and other graphics. Note that according to the author guidelines, first person and/or the \"royal we\" are not considered acceptable in this journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do **not** use others' graphics in your submission. All ideas, software libraries, and text that aren't your own must be cited, but concepts that you develop from the ground up do not have to be cited. For example, if you develop a Jacobian for your robot and you explain what it is, this does not need to be (and should not be) something you cite if you show all of the steps. **Please avoid citing ES302 notes**, and instead summarize any relevant derivations yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been reading lots of papers in the robotics literature this semester, so feel free to use strong papers you've found to help you develop your own paper's tone, style, and organization. The categories below summarizing \"key elements of a good technical paper\" can also be used as section headings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration (multimedia requirement)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will note that in the IEEE transactions on Robotics guidelines for authors, multimedia supplements to a paper are encouraged. You **will**, as part of your final paper submission, need to submit a video showing your study's key results (either in simulation or physical experiment). This does not have to be a fancy edit, but it does have to support your paper's conclusions and should be referenced in the text of the paper. www.osf.io offers an archival way to host videos and datasets, but you can also link to a publicly shared video on Google Drive, as long as that video is hosted in your ES302 folder. Do not host videos on your \"My Drive,\" as these will disappear after you graduate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectations for paper depth and scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a peer reviewer for IEEE Transactions on Robotics, I will not be combing your source code when evaluating your final project. This means that the paper and video must stand alone in explaining your work. Therefore, you should be providing enough detail in the text of your paper for me to understand the technical details of your approach. Feel free to reach out or share drafts of sections if you'd like advanced feedback on your level of detail; as a rule of thumb, someone reasonably familiar with key concepts in robotics (kinematics, dynamics, path planning, perception & sensing) should be able to reproduce your experiment based on your paper. This means that key details about physical and simulation parameters **must be communicated** along with equations, coordinate frames, and anything else that would be required for someone to build upon your experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectations for graphical communication\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of a good paper is good graphics and figures. Please budget plenty of time to develop graphics and figures that help communicate your ideas, especially when it comes to explaining coordinate systems, maps, path planning, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "My preferred tool for you all to use is an online diagram tool called www.draw.io . This tool offers a way to produce vector, raster, and combined graphics quickly. It even lets you include LaTeX code in a figure for mathematical symbols. I've even used it to produce graphics for my own publications; see [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-021-00885-7) for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond explanatory graphics, please make sure your figures look professional and are properly labeled and captioned. I am happy to help you with any of this, but please ensure that what you include in your paper is something you'd be happy with the world seeing in 10 years when you're a famous roboticist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper you produce will be graded on a 60-point scale like your literature review and your project proposal. The demonstration video will be combined with your poster score to represent 8% of your final grade as per the syllabus."

    "\n",
    "In addition to your final project paper, you will also present your work to your engineering division peers at the joint poster session on Wednesday, December 14 from 8-11 in the Kamine gym. The poster you will prepare is for a \"curated poster session,\" meaning that the poster should provide graphical support for a short talk you'll give to those walking by, but it should **not** be a completely stand-alone document.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will upload your poster in PDF form by midnight on Thursday, December 12, 2024 to [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1chn1T6dplZrbUDYITZcvgYhumCd82Tlc?usp=drive_link). There will be no extensions or exceptions. You will receive a zero for the poster presentation if your paper is not uploaded by the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also bring a phone, tablet, computer, or live demo to support your poster. Please let me know what your needs are for this as we get closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of your poster is up to you, but it should be 48\"x36\" in size. You can and should prepare your poster using Google Slides by creating a custom slide size. Using Google Slides will allow you to show me drafts and get feedback to improve your poster before submitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Visual Appearance\n",
    "    - Balance of figures and text\n",
    "    - Quality of graphics\n",
    "    - Layout, Color Choices, and Design capture attention\n",
    "* Organization and Flow\n",
    "    - Poster layout allows audience to follow your work\n",
    "    - background, methodology, key results, and conclusions are presented effectively\n",

This should be a compact version of your literature review that receives updates as needed to contextualize your project in terms of what other papers are out there. Even if you're doing something that \"has been done\" before, there is likely something novel about your particular experimental setup or approach, even if it is \"this type of experiment has never been performed in the WeBots simulator.\" At the conclusion of this section, you should be able to make a statement about how your work will fill a gap in the literature, so be sure that your edits to your literature review make this case without disrupting the flow of the paper.\n",
