    "# Background Resources\n",

    "## Textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "In ES302, we will be leaning heavily on reading assignments from [An Introduction to Autonomous Robots](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1765a7bTY-nYGvFJMP41YahOQEy6gtGxN/view?usp=sharing) by Nikolaus Correll. The book is free to download at the link above if you are signed in to your Lafayette Google account on your browser, but it is also open source, with updates submitted often to the book's [Github repository](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Autonomous-Robots/Introduction-to-Autonomous-Robots). A Git repository is a complete record of a textfile-based project (such as code or a book) that includes its entire revision history. We will learn more about Git as a way to organize your work as the semester progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supplemental Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The textbook, like all textbooks, won't cover everything we need in the proper amount of detail. I will be releasing supplemental material in the form of webpages (based on the Jupyter notebook platform) that cover course concepts that don't receive a sufficient treatment in the text. An example is the [Romi Resource](../02_Romi_Resources/02A_Romi_Resource.ipynb), which introduces you to the robot we'll be using for class exercises and homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling of Physical Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In ES302, you will need a basic understanding of how interconnected systems of electrical, mechanical, and fluid systems (among others) can be modeled using differential equations. You can find a full set of course notes for ES103, which covers this type of modeling, at [this link](https://alexanderallenbrown.github.io/ES103_SP22_Students). You can also find an abridged version of the course content in [this document](./01B_ES103_Summary_Resource.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "ES302 also requires a basic proficiency in writing code to analyze data and direct/interact with robots and their environment. You should already be familiar with basic programming concepts, and with the [MATLAB/Octave](https://alexanderallenbrown.github.io/ES103_SP22_Students/Programming_Resource/Programming_Resource.html) language. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, interacting with robots will require you to build on your prior programming skills. In ES302, we will build bridges between robots and computers using the Python programming language. A quick introduction to Python is given in [this document](./01C_Python_Resource.ipynb). We will also do a bit of robot programming using the Arduino language. A quick introduction to the Arduino language is given in [this document](./01D_Arduino_resource.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will require a basic understanding of Calculus 1 through calculus 3, along with differential equations, and a bit of linear algebra. There are appendices to the textbook that cover most of what you'll need!"
